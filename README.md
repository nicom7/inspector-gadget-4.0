# Inspector Gadget

A general-purpose GDScript UI for building editor functionality inside Godot.

## Overview

Inspector gadget is a set of GDScript UI controls designed to read and write object properties at runtime. It extends the standard `get_indexed()` function from the `Node` class with support for arrays and dictionaries, allowing for fully-recursive property visualization and editing using `NodePath` subnames.

## Features

- Inspect and edit the properties of any object from inside your Godot game
- Address any property with string-based subnames
  - Example: `SomeNode:resource_property:dictionary_property:[values]:3`
- Selectively hide properties via blacklist
- Visualize custom `Resource` subclasses with your own controls
- Type-hint typeless structures like `Array` and `Dictionary` for full control over UI
- Easily filter built-in properties, leaving only custom script data

## Example Content

`example.tscn` in the `scenes` folder contains a visual example of the Inspector Gadget UI, and includes visualization and editing for each of Godot's built-in basic types.
